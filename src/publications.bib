Wearable fitness trackers and smartphone health apps have become increasingly popular. These technologies can track a diverse range of data relating to health, such as heart rate, physical activity, and mood. Such data could provide clinicians with a better understanding of a patient's condition leading to improvements in patient care, prevention of disease, and reduced burden on health services. The aim of this work is to investigate the opportunities and workflows for using self-tracked data in clinical settings with the vision of improving care.

Through reviewing literature on the use of personal data and making clinical decisions within time and resource constraints, this dissertation synthesises a series of cognitive biases pertaining to a number of clinical scenarios. From this, the dangers and consequences of their use in healthcare are assessed.          The increasing ubiquity of personal tracking devices is leading to the possibility of using health and wellbeing data to support clinical decisions. Hundreds of devices, mobile apps and social networking websites exist to record personal information related to health, including weight, diet and activity. Such data has been demonstrated as providing self-insight and promoting positive health behaviours, such as maintaining a healthy diet. As such, there has been interest in its use by clinicians to support decision making. However, clinicians' ability to interpret data may be prone to cognitive bias and poor judgement.         Through reviewing literature on the use of personal data and making clinical decisions within time and resource constraints, this dissertation synthesises a series of cognitive biases pertaining to a number of clinical scenarios. From this, the dangers and consequences of their use in healthcare are assessed. In agreement with previous research, the biases identified pose a greater risk within scenarios where there is limited time and resources. Drawing from these results, this dissertation forms framework for future research into data use in clinical scenarios. Supervised by Richard Giordano and Max Van Kleek.},

  abstract      = {Independent research into designing an efficient mobile interface for capturing rationale behind peer-produced recommendations. Involved project management, background research, surveys and user studies. First-class.         Third year project that involved designing an efficient mobile interface for capturing rationale behind peer-produced recommendations. Using mobiles to find information online can be a demanding task: the daunting quantity of unrelated or inaccurate information swamps genuinely useful information, making it difficult to find helpful information in situations where the mobile phone is not the primary focus or where time is short. This project investigates a method of forming recommendations from peer-produced information for the purpose of serendipitous discovery or decision support. As such, this project contributes two sets of findings. The first pertains to a probe study where, through the role-play of participants, we establish what people recommend and why. This allows the forming of a structure for storing the rationale behind a recommendation as metadata. The second relates to the design of a mobile interface, Groovy, for the capturing of rational as structured metadata; namely, how effectively it captures rationale and how it performs compared to existing interfaces. Through a field study of this interface in a photo-tagging game, we consider how such a tool could impact on people's every-day activities in practice.},
