	<p>On an evening two weeks ago, <a href=
	"http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10691197.Power_cut_in_Southampton/">a power-cut in
	Southampton</a> plunged the city into darkness. As much of the city&rsquo;s buildings
	lost power, people started wandering out onto the streets. Despite the power cut
	lasting no longer than 30 minutes, there was a faint air of panic as everyone was
	reminded of how much they have come to be dependent on electricity. I was one of them
	&ndash; living in a modern flat, no electricity means no lighting, no cooking
	facilities and no running water &ndash; the basic amenities of modern life.</em></p>

	<p>But I was also reminded that the Web is just as vulnerable. Much like
	electricity, the web has become something we are dependent on. And like electricity,
	the complex infrastructure that delivers Internet to our homes is prone to disruption
	through countless ways. The Southampton power-cut was caused the failure of a single
	substation. Likewise, the failure of a single point on the Internet infrastructure can
	cause huge disruption. The reasons may be <a href=
	"http://www.renesys.com/2005/12/internetwide-nearcatastrophela/">accidental</a>&nbsp;or
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Red_worm">malicious</a>.</p>

	<p>So over the next few weeks, I am going to consider what might happen if the web were
	to disappear. Given that there is still <a href=
	"http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">over half the world&rsquo;s
	population</a> to start using the Web, it seems an appropriate time to why this is and
	whether this impacts their lives. For example, the widespread political issues
	surrounding web availability, such as restrictive firewalls and censorship, could
	provide insight into how loss of access to the Web affects us already.</p>

	<p>Literature in <strong>Social Anthropology</strong> can tell us how humans have
	historically dealt with loss of perceived necessities, whether it be wartime rationing
	or survival during and after natural disasters. Perhaps this can help us prepare for a
	disaster that leads to the loss of the web. And if we did lose the Web, what would the
	impact be? Modern civilisation is governed through <strong>Economics</strong>, which,
	considering how the Web has become a platform for economic prosperity, could be one of
	the most affected areas.</p>

	<p>The uptake of the web is not stopping <a href=
	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage">any time soon</a>, and the loss of
	the web could be detrimental to a future society. Now is an important time to get a
	better understanding of what the consequences of loosing the web would be.</p>
