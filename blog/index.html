However, our analysis of existing social networks has revealed a <a href="http://blog.soton.ac.uk/orion/analysis/existing-similar-gaming-social-networks-part-1/">large number of gaming social networks</a> already available.&nbsp;The core team had a discussion today about the viability of GameX within this niche, and have decided that it has little unique experience to offer to gamers. Other networks are available for sharing gaming experience in the ways we proposed, and we could not think of any unique features we could add to this that would entice gamers from existing networks.</p><a class="readmore" href="/blog/2014/leapinit-a-virtual-world-social-network_.html">Read more</a></li>

In particular, I will consider how the loss of power is analogous to the loss of the web as a convenience, a luxury, and as a life-supporting mechanism. &nbsp;By making these connections, we should be able to get a better understanding of the anthropological and economic issues at hand, as these are very pertinent to how society has used both electricity and the web in human and economic development.</p><a class="readmore" href="/blog/2013/web-doomsday-northeast-blackout-case-study.html">Read more</a></li>
