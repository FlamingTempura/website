	<p>I woke this morning to people emailing me that I've been sending them spam links via Skype. My account had been compromised. How had this happened?</p>

	<p>I thought I was fairly safe from hackers. I choose secure passwords. I had enabled Microsoft's two-factor authentication - to log in to Skype I need to type in a random code received by SMS or email.</p>

	<p>It turns out that there is a way to completely bypass Microsoft's 2FA. Simply use your original Skype username and password to log in. You will not be prompted to enter the code.</p>

	<p>I didn't even know that login still existed after Skype was absorbed into Microsoft. That password was several years old, devised when I thought "fr3d123" would suffice. It's probably floating around in several stolen forum databases.</p>

	<p>Microsoft's 2FA had given me a false sense of security. I'd bolted the door shut but left the window wide open.</p>

	<p>This is a serious flaw in Microsoft's security practices. It has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13561024/microsoft-skype-baidu-linkedin-hack">reported</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5gk6af/you_and_your_users_should_immediately_disable/">before</a>. But Skype has done nothing to fix it, nor has made efforts to disable old credentials.</p>

	<p>(And let's hope that Microsoft decide not to make GitHub users start logging in via Microsoft.)</p>

	<p>To fix, go to <a href="https://account.live.com/SignInPreferences">https://account.live.com/SignInPreferences</a> and disable any old log in aliases.</p>
