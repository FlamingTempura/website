		<h1>Disruption and Innovation to Workforces in the Information Age</a></h1>

	<p>The information age has brought rapid innovation to the creation, management, and distribution of information. Now, organisations need to spend time thinking about whether to adopt new technologies to improve their effectiveness. But it is often unclear how these technologies disrupt work practices.</p>

	<p>One such emerging technology is the distributed ledger, which is the technology behind Bitcoin. These distributed ledgers detail every financial transaction made using Bitcoin and are publically shared amongst a large number of people. Anybody can verify that transactions in the ledger are valid.</p>

	<p>Distributed ledgers bring accountability to Bitcoin to prevent fraud and corruption. Beyond cryptocurrencies, distributed ledgers could provide accountability to food supply chains, the storage of criminal evidence, degree certification, and digital identity. This potential for distributed ledgers means that organisations are increasingly considering using these technologies.</p>

	<h3>Technology Overload</h3>

	<p>In recent years technologies have emerged which, like distributed ledgers, aim to solve common information problems we face nowadays:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Distributed ledgers for making data manipulation more accountable,</li>
		<li>Cloud storage for making information accessible from anywhere in the world,</li>
		<li>Blockchain for preventing the tampering of data, and</li>
		<li>Document-based databases for storing unstructured information.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With so many new technologies, organisations are facing a technology overload. Organisations are overwhelmed by the number of technologies they need to evaluate and adopt. Moreover, each technology brings its own disruption to workforces, in both positive and negative ways.</p>

	<p>For example, adopting distributed ledgers for accounting may require retraining staff to understand new concepts and use new software. But the outcome of this could be improved accountability.</p>

	<p>Yet there is often an overeagerness to use new technology. The popularity of Bitcoin has prompted enthusiasm towards distributed ledgers. But distributed ledgers are not the answer to every problem, and they could bring significant disruption to organisations.</p>

	<h3>Disruption and Innovation to Workforces</h3>

	<p>How can organisations decide when and what technology should be adopted?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>On one extreme, adopting new technologies too often and too frequently risks too much disruption to workforces. An organisation could become burdened by constantly needing to adapt to new technologies.</li>

		<li>On the other extreme, adopting new technology rarely and infrequently brings less disruption to workforces, but risks a lack of innovation.</li>
	
		<li>Adopting appropriate technology at the right time enables innovation while not burdening an organisation with significant disruption to workforces.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Overcoming the overload of technology requires considering how technology can cause disruption and enable innovation. Most of all, organisations must consider how to adopt appropriate technology at the right time.</p>
